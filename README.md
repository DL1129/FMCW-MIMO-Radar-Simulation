# FMCW-MIMO-Radar-Simulation

## This repository is a simulation frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW), multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radars.

`FMCW_simulation.m` is the main script which creates point targets at estimates their range, velocity and angle information.

`FMCW_sim_v2.m` is the main script which reads 3-D coordinates of human skeleton joints captured by Kinect v2 device. For more information about the data capture and skeleton extraction using Kinect, check out the [Kinect repository](https://github.com/ekurtgl/Kinect). This script has not finished yet.
